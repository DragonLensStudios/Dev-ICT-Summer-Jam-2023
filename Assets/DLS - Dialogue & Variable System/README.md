# DLS - Dialogue & Variable System

Welcome to our project which leverages XNode to develop a dynamic dialogue and variable system for Unity. 

## Description

This project integrates XNode, a free and open-source dialogue system for Unity, to provide a powerful and customizable dialogue and variable system. It allows for complex dialogue trees and the handling of game variables within dialogue. This tool can be highly beneficial for game developers looking to create narrative-driven games with intricate storytelling elements.

## Getting Started

Read the DLS.Dialogue System User Guide in the `Documentation` folder.

## Documentation

Detailed user guides are available to help you understand and get the most out of this system:

- `DLS.Dialogue System User Guide`: Learn how to use the dialogue system, from creating basic dialogues to managing intricate dialogue trees with multiple choices and variable considerations.

- `Object Parsing String Extensions User Guide`: Understand the various string extensions we provide for parsing objects. This guide will show you how to use these extensions to easily parse objects into strings, which can then be used in dialogues.

You can find these files in the `Documentation` folder of this project.
